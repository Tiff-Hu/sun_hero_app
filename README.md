# sun_hero_app

UI / front-end prototype for a mobile app concept focused on sun-exposure education and chronic skin disease prevention for children.

## Overview
`sun_hero_app` is a lightweight front-end (HTML/CSS) prototype exploring the user experience and screen flow for a child- and parent-friendly sun safety app. The goal is to present sun exposure guidance in a clear, engaging way that supports prevention behaviors for pediatric skin-related chronic conditions.

## What’s in this repo
- Multiple HTML screens (`index.html`, `index1.html`, `index2.html`, `index3.html`, `index4.html`) representing different views / iterations of the UI
- Static assets (e.g., images)
- A simple permissions screen (`permissions.html`) for illustrating how the app might request user access (e.g., notifications)

## How to view locally
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or drag into a browser window).
3. Navigate between screens using the links/buttons in the UI.

## Notes
- This repository is primarily a **UI/UX front-end prototype** and does not include a production backend, data pipeline, or deployed mobile build.
- Content is for demonstration purposes and is **not medical advice**.

## Future improvements (optional)
- Consolidate screens into a single routed front-end (React / Vue) for maintainability
- Add responsive mobile styling and accessibility (ARIA labels, contrast checks)
- Connect to a lightweight backend for user preferences, reminders, and logging
- Add an onboarding flow for parents/guardians and age-appropriate modes
